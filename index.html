            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an undergraduate at Santa Clara University studying Computer 
                Science and Engineering. Outside of my classes, I like learning more about tools
                used for software development, regardless whether it is frontend 
                or backend. Recently, I've been focused on learning more about 
                React and MySQL, as well as improving my coding skills. I also enjoy drawing, listening to music, 
                and creating my own stories in my spare time.</p>

            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>I learned how to program in Java, C, and C++ in my classes and dedicated my own
                time in improving in those languages as well as learning Python and JavaScript. I've 
                also taken courses on data structures, object-oriented programming, logic design,
                 probability, statistics, discrete mathmatics as well as science courses like physics 
                and chemistry. I also have experience with frameworks such as Flask and React. I've learned 
                how to use tools such as Postman and IDEs like Eclipse, XCode, and Visual Studio Code. 
                I've also been learning how to create and manage databases using MySQL.
